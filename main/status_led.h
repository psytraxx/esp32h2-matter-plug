// Plug's WiFi-status LED (PIN_LED in board_pins.h), repurposed here as the
// Matter network/commissioning indicator. The plug's other LED (measured on
// the P26/relay net in the original CB2S wiring) sits on the relay drive net
// in hardware and follows relay state without a GPIO of its own; see relay.cpp.
//
// The XIAO's own onboard LED (PIN_ONBOARD_LED) shows both, with commissioning
// taking priority: it blinks along with the plug's LED while the commissioning
// window is open, and otherwise follows relay state. Relay state matters on the
// bench because the relay coil runs off a mains-derived rail and will not
// physically click on USB-only power (see relay.h), so this LED is the only
// feedback that a controller toggle actually landed.
//
// PIN_LED polarity is UNVERIFIED — confirm on the bench (README's Verification
// section) before relying on "off" meaning what you expect. PIN_ONBOARD_LED is
// driven active-low, which is the usual wiring for the XIAO's user LED.
